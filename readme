Welcome to rhoc, rodri's high-order calculator. This program is
already shipping with plan 9 so, in order to separate it from the
original, here is my version.

I'm creating a folder per stage as it is explained in tupe [1], like
`s1', `s2', for stage one and two respectively.

I also took the freedom to create the program my own way, so it's not
exactly as shown in the book, although it's got the same features.  In
addition to UTF support (fuck you lex!)
